#### Myself and My Motivations

My name is Benjamin Dalusma and I hail from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I am senior in the college of Agriculture and Life Science. I'm majoring in Applied Economics and Management and minoring in Statistics. I've always been interested in mathematics but unfortunately being part of the undergraduate business school, I never really had the chance to develop many of those skills due to the nature of traditional requirements of a business program. 

At the end of my sophomore year, I decided that I wanted to explore more mathematics/statistics courses. This lead me to completely finish my introductory math/stats classes (Calc1 through 3, Linear Algebra, Computer Science, Probability Theory and Statistics). 

This passion for mathematics and statistics guided my choice and now I am exploring more advanced options/topics in the field of probability, statistics and decision theory. I am particularly interested by decision models and I'm hoping that learning Bayesian Methods, I'll be able to narrow down my graduate school interests but also understand a different way of approaching a problem and how to analyze it.

#### Data Analysis Topic of Interest
My interests in data analysis are fairly broad. I will say however that intend on using the Bayesian methods in two main areas:

1. ***Decision theory problems*** (relevant to marketing, economics and business).
2. ***Sports Statistics problems*** (ranking teams and predicting wins-loss records [Soccer](http://probabilityandlaw.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-problem-with-predicting-football.html), [more soccer](http://www.pinnaclesports.com/en/betting-articles/sport/bayesian-analysis-and-sports-betting) and [football](http://ccrg.rit.edu/~whelan/talks/whelan20101008.pdf))
